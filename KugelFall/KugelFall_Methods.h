  Calculates the time parameters required for releasing a ball based on the time difference between the current time and the previous time.

  --------
  The function returns an integer that indicates the rotation mode. The possible values are:

    - 3: Fast rotation mode.
    - 2: Middle rotation mode.
    - 1: Slow rotation mode.

  Global Variables:
  ----------------
  t_u: Time difference between the current time and the previous time. (current rotation time)
  now_time: Current time.
  old_time: Previous time.
  fall_time: Time required for the ball to reach the hole after it is released.
  abwurf_time_min: Minimum time for ball release.
  abwurf_time_max: Maximum time for ball release.
  pred: Predicted time for the next rotation.
  c: Delta coefficient for dropping time correction.


  Explanation:
  ------------
  This function calculates the time parameters required for releasing a ball based on the time difference (t_u) between the current time and the previous time.

  The function works in three modes:

    - Fast rotation mode: (rotation time less than 450 ms)
        - The minimum time for ball release (abwurf_time_min) is calculated by adding 
                    the predicted time for the next rotation, 
                    the predicted time for the rotation after next 
                    and the time required for the ball to reach the hole after it is released. 
        - The maximum time for ball release (abwurf_time_max) is calculated by multiplying abwurf_time_min by a hole factor.
    
    - Slow rotation mode: (rotation time is greater than 2000 ms)
        - The function calculates abwurf_time_min (the minimum time for ball release) 
                    by adding current rotation time (t_u) 
                    to the time difference between the current time and the ball falling time (now_time - fall_time). 
        - The correction coefficient (c) is calculated by mapping t_u from 2000 to 5000 to the range -0.01 to 0.07 
                    using the map_float function. 
        - abwurf_time_min is adjusted by adding t_u multiplied by c. 
        - abwurf_time_max is calculated by multiplying abwurf_time_min by a hole factor.

    - Middle rotation mode: (rotation time between 450 ms and 2000 ms)
        - The function calculates abwurf_time_min (the minimum time for ball release)
                    by adding the predicted time for the next rotation (pred)
                    to the time difference between the current time and the ball falling time (now_time - fall_time). 
        - The delta coefficient (c) is calculated by mapping t_u from 450 to 2000 to the range -0.19 to 0.039 
                    using the map_float function. 
        - abwurf_time_min is adjusted by adding t_u multiplied by c.
        - abwurf_time_max is calculated by multiplying abwurf_time_min by a hole factor.
